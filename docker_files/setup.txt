# GENERAL STEPS TO UP POSTGRESQL DOCKER CONTAINER
1. Run `lsof -i :5432` to see if anything is currently occupying that port.
- If so, run `sudo kill [pid]` to get rid of it.
    - I found that my local postgres was occupying that port so this might be the case for you
2. Run `docker build -t dsc180b-image .`
3. Run `docker run -p 5432:5432 --name dsc180b-container -d dsc180b-image`
